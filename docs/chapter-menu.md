# Chapter Menu

Panels will automatically generate a chapter menu for your comic based on your sequence titles. You don't need to do anything to enable this menu except set the [`title`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/comic-data/sequences#title) property of the sequences you wish to appear in the menu.

Users access your chapter list from the Playdate system menu.

The default settings display all named sequences in the menu, but only the chapters which the user has completed will be selectable.

## Settings

Chapter menu behavior can be customized by altering your comic's [Settings]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/settings/#chapter-menu-settings).

With these settings you can add a logo image to the menu's header, change whether or not to display locked sequences, or choose to not use the chapter menu at all.
