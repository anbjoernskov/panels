### Troubleshooting

#### Errors

Check the console in the Playdate Simulator for helpful errors or messages.

A build error pointing to your data file usually indicates a formatting error. Make sure all quotes and braces are closed. Check for missing commas in between items.

An error pointing to code within Panels may still be caused by missing info in your data file. Take a look at the portion of the code with the error and see which item(s) is causing the error. Check the section of your data file that provides those items to make sure you're specifying the proper paths, names, values, etc.

If everything looks good, you may have found a bug! Please [report it](#bug-reports) so it can get fixed.
